# SimRace
Windesheim year 2 OOSD Race simulator

The assignment: create a race simulator in C#.

Im using a canvas from spector instead of the traditional cursorposition.
For the assignment we needed to use WPF for the app, I choose to be one of the first to use MAUI at Windesheim for this assignment. 
MAUI makes the program compatible for ios, android, Windows & macOS.
