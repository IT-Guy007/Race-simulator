#Race simulator
Windesheim year 2 OOSD Race simulator

The assignment: create 2 race simulators in C#.

The assignment is as follows:
- Create a console racesimulator using cursor position
- Create a race simulator in WPF

I chose to use Spector for the console version instead of the traditional, because the result is more appealing.

I also chose to use MAUI instead of WPF, I'm one the only students at Windesheim to use this, I chose this because it's not only harder due to the lack of documentation and help that can be provided by teachers, but also the change of using MAUI in the future is significant higher then WPF.
