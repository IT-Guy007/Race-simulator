#Race simulator
Windesheim year 2 OOSD Race simulator

The assignment: create 2 race simulators in C#.

The assignment is as follows:
- Create a console racesimulator using cursor position
- Create a race simulator in WPF

I chose to use Spector for the console version instead of the traditional, because the result is more appealing.

I also chose to use MAUI instead of WPF, I'm the first at Windesheim to use this. 
MAUI makes the program compatible for IOS, Android, Windows & macOS.
