#Race simulator
Windesheim year 2 OOSD Race simulator

The assignment: create 2 race simulators in C#.

The assignment is as follows:
- Create a console racesimulator using cursor position(used spector instead)
- Create a race simulator in WPF(used MAUI instead)

I chose to use Spector for the console version instead of the traditional, because the result is more appealing.

I also chose to use MAUI instead of WPF, I chose this because it's not only harder due to the lack of documentation and help that can be provided by teachers(because they haven't used it yet), but also the chance of using MAUI in the future is significant higher then WPF.
